The Nomina Vitiorum 06 Lincolnshire is incomplete, the names
06 the respective lords being entirely omitted. On page 246, is an
account 06 the serjeanty 06 the King's champion, whn, as such, held
and holds the manor 06 Scrivelsby.

Two separate documents relating to the Aid 06 1428 in Lincolnshire
’ are printed in the present volume, one 06 them aseries of inquisitione
in the different wapentakes, the other a collectors' account arranged,
as in 1303 and 1346, in groups of sees. Although they cover the
same ground, it has been considered desirable to print both 06 them
as helpful towards the identification 06 place-names. There seems to
have been some difficulty in raising the subsidy 06 1428 in this
county, the collectore even declaring themselves unable to proceed propter
metum mortis. (Scep. 301.)

In Middlesex, the inquisition in conrlexion with the Aid 06 1346
was not taken until 1353. An exhaustive list 06 churches iu the city
06 London‚ arranged under their respective wards, will be found ¹ou
pagos sss-sss. ’

considerable interest attaches to the roll printed in the Appendix
to this volume, Its history, prior to its acquisition by the British
Museum, is obscure, although some 06 the statements in Blomfield's
History of Norsollc seem to be based upon it. All other returns
made in connexion with the Aid of 1401-02, printed in this and the
preceding volumes, give the names 06 those persons only who held 06
tho Orown sice credie, in accordance with the statute 06 26 Edward ΙΙΙ,
under which it was levied. Mr. Inman (Domcsdap aad Fcudol'Statistics,
p. 70) has called attention to the small amount of money collected in
comparison with the yield 06 the previous aid 06 1346, and the return
for (lomwnll, printed iu this work (Vol. Ι. p. 219), shows thatin the
whole 06 that county only one half see was held direct 06 the Orown

by military service.
