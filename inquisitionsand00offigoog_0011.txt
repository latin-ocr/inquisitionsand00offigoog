PREFACE.

'1¹11ss scope 01 this work has been explained so fully in the Preface
to the First Volume, that it is only necessary to add a few words with
regard to matters peculiar to this third instalment.

In connexion with Lancashire, it should be ohserved that the

returns for the Duchy of Lancaster have been reserved 101 separate
treatment.

The error with regard to the date 01 Kirkby’s Quost 101 Leicester·
shire has been noticed already (Vol. 1. pp. ix, xix). For this
county the returns are arranged in groups 01 homogeneous sees, and

not according to hundreds as in most other cases. Asupplementary list

01 sees belonging to the Honor 01 Belvoir, given only in the late
Exchequer MS. (KR, vol. 17) Miscellaneous Books, has been omitted,
as it proves to be merely a transcript from the socalled Teste dc
Neoill.

The section 01 Kirkby’s Quest dealing with Lincolnshire is
printed on pp· 366-371 01 the present volume, having been madvertently

omitted from its proper place in chronological order.

The document which has been used 101 the Aid 01 1303 in that
county purports to be a transcript 01 the Collectors' accormt 01 1303,
handed to the collectore 01 the Aid 01 1346 101 their information
and guidance. It does not, however, give details 01 the sums 01 money
charged. Here again, as in the earlier return 101 leicestershire, the
arrangement is by groups 01 sees, in each of the three great divisions
01 the county, Lindsey, Kesteven, and Holland.
