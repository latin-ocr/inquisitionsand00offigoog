The return for Norfollr‚ however, gives the names of all
holders of knights' sees, and also the names of the supposed mesne
lords. It seems to have been based upon the retum of 1346, the
names os the actual tenanta being duly corrected, while in many
cases the names of the mesne lords were allowed to remain unohanged.

The exact object os the return hae not been ascertained, but it is

worthy of remark that there are marginal notes opposite to mentions
of sees belonging to the Duchy os lancaster.

The text of this volume hasbeen prepared by Mr. J. V. Lyle and
Mr. A. E. Stamp os this llepartment and the former has prepared the

Indexes.
